# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first create an issue for the change you wish to make, and reach an agreement
with a previous contributor on what path to take before opening a pull request. If it helps you may link to the branch that
would close the issue in your own fork, but do not create a pull request until a decision is reached.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch with a brief name that describes the feature or fix
3. Ensure tests are passing
4. Open a pull request with a brief "goal" of the PR, point out any new or changed tests relating to this feature, and state
what version number should be incremented in the [semantic version](https://semver.org/).
